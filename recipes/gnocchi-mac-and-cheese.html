    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>For this gnocchi mac and cheese, I combine two favorites, baking pillowy gnocchi in a rich Cheddar cheese sauce. You won't miss the macaroni at all.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup evaporated milk or half-and-half, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon prepared mustard</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded sharp extra-sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Cheddar cheese powder</li>
            <li>12 ounces refrigerated prepared gnocchi</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium high-heat. Whisk in flour until smooth, and cook about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Whisk in cream, evaporated milk, Worcestershire, and mustard. Stir in Cheddar cheese and cheese powder and cook until cheese melts, about 2 minutes. If you prefer a thinner sauce, add evaporated milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until sauce is the consistency you like.</li>
            <li>Stir in gnocchi; pour mixture into a small baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 20 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
